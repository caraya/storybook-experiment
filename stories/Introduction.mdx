# Rivendellweb Pattern Library

This is a reworking of my pattern and ideas libraries on Storybook, both as a way to learn Storybook and as a migration from Fractal. Eventually this will be moved to [patterns](https://patterns.rivendellweb.net)

## Explanations

This is what I have so far...

### Foundations

The elements under foundation are core to building a web page and include colors, typography and a basic set of icons taken from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

### Docs

Essays and explanations of certain elements, both foundations and components.

### Components

Corresponding to molecules in atomic design
