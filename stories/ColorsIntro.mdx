# List of Colors

## The new defaults

I took the color palette from [The New Defaults](http://dudleystorey.github.io/thenewdefaults/) by [Dudley Storey](https://twitter.com/dudleystorey) and converted them to [CSS Custom Properties](CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables Module Level 1) so I can play with them easier in code accross the system.

## Mopar Colors

The second set of colors, the one I labeled Funky Colors, are my interpretation of the colors used in Mopar cars in the late 1960s and early 1970s... nothing screamed out loud like cars painted in colors like Plum Crazy Purple or Top Banana :).
